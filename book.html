              Under Satoshi's rules, all can see consensus as consensus,<br />
              only because there are hard-forks,<br />
              All can know compatible upgrades as good, only because there are
              chain- splits,<br />
              Spending and receiving Bitcoin just re-organizes the UTXO set,<br /><br />
              The difficulty adjustment is born in the easy, <br />

              Before and after Segwit go along with each other<br /><br />

              They can broadcast transactions offline,<br />
              And HODL without effort,<br />

              He works, not for block reward,<br />

              The bitcoiner governs<br />
              by clearing their mempool and consolidating UTXOs,<br />
              by weakening forks<br />

              They see the first 10,000 inscriptions as part of the UTXO set.<br />
              The bitcoiner is not sentimental;<br />
              he treats all his UTXOs as fungible.<br /><br />

              He spends and replaces, without condition,<br />
              circulating his UTXOs to everyone.<br /><br />

              The bitcoiner that never dies<br />
              is called the mysterious Satoshi.<br />
              Although they become legend and lore,<br />
              their initial selflessness is never lost.<br />
              Although they assume countless fake names,<br />
              their true pseudonymity remains intact.<br /><br />

              The gateway to the mysterious Satoshi<br />
              is called the Merkle root of the Genesis block.<br /><br />

              Listen to the Coinbase,<br />
              hear its echo through block creation.<br />
              Without fail, it reveals it's subsidy.<br />
              Without fail, the halvings bring us to our own

              Bitcoin is eternal - the blockchain endures.<br />
              Why do bitcoin and the blockchain last forever?<br />
              It does not exist for Cantillionaires only.<br />
              That is the secret of its durability.<br /><br />

              For this reason the bitcoiner submits his transactions last,<br />
              and so ends up broadcasting at a low fee rate.<br />
              His transaction data stays segregated from the witness,<br />
              so they confirm at a smaller weight.<br /><br />

              Serve the needs of the miners,<br />
              and all your own transactions will be confirmed.<br />
              Through selfless mining,<br />
              no-KYC bitcoin is attained.<br />

              Their coins flow to low places loathed by all Bcash-maxis,<br />
              Therefore, they are like Satoshi.<br /><br />

              Live in accordance with the nature of consensus.<br />
              In spending, be aware of coin days destroyed,<br />
              In UTXO consolidation, go deep in previous chainalysis,<br />
              In receiving from others, provide both QR and copy/paste options.<br />
              Stand by never re-using addresses. Govern with your own node.<br />
              Be timely in broadcasting transactions to the mempool.<br /><br />

              One who lives in accordance with the longest-chain of work,<br />

              Why are influencers and groupthink alarming?<br />

              consensus arises.<br /><br />

              He who uses bitcoin does not want blocks to be full.<br />
              But precisely because they are never full,<br />
              he can remain mining like off-grid,<br />
              and does not rush for early hashrate accumulation.

              Become totally empty.<br />
              Let the mempool clear.<br />
              Amidst the rush of daily transactions,<br />
              observe how the pending become confirmed.<br />

              Blocks confirm, each by each,<br />
              only to become index to the chaintip…<br />
              to what is settled, and what is to be.<br /><br />

              To return to the mempool is to Replace-by-Fee.<br />
              To run nodes is to fulfill the Whitepaper destiny.<br />
              To fulfill Whitepaper destiny is to be in consensus.<br />
              To enforce consensus is called a true Bitcoiner.<br />
              Not knowing this cycle<br />
              leads to eternal hard forks.<br /><br />

              Knowing the protocol rules gives consensus.<br />
              This consensus is distributed.<br />
              Distributed consensus is the highest security;<br />
              the highest security is Bitcoin.<br />

              Using Bitcoin, your transactions will be at one with consensus.<br />
              Being at one with consensus is essential.<br />
              This way is everlasting,<br />
              not endangered by the Fiat death.

              With the greatest monetary asset before them,<br />
              people barely know one exists.<br />
              Next comes one with high-yield savings rates.<br />
              Next comes one with untenable inflation.<br />
              Next comes one with complete capital controls.<br /><br />

              When the Central Banks trust no one,<br />
              no one trusts them.<br />
              The great bitcoiner worries little.<br />
              He never spends carelessly.<br />
              He mines for network security<br />
              and leaves no CO2 emissions.<br />

              When the hardness of Bitcoin is present,<br />
              value arises from one's proof of work.<br />
              When the hardness of Bitcoin is absent,<br />
              value comes from the rules<br />
              of "stable prices and maximum employment."<br /><br />

              If you need stable prices and maximum employment for sound money,<br />
              if you act with moral hazard,<br />
              this is a sure sign that hard money is absent.<br />
              Thus we see the great monetary trilemma.<br /><br />

              When currency falls into fractionalization,<br />
              inflation and entitlement programs arise.<br />
              When the country falls into hyperinflation,<br />
              totalitarian leaders will appear;<br />
              revolution is born.

              Give up fiat lifestyle and you will be free from all your cares.<br />
              What is the difference between Bitcoin and fiat?<br />
              What is the difference between good money and bad?<br /><br />

              Must I fear what others fear?<br />
              Should I fear bank runs<br />
              when there is verifiable self-custody?<br />
              Should I fear fractionalization,<br />
              when my node is confirming the UTXO set?<br /><br />

              In "DeFi summer" , some go to protocols to trade altcoins,<br />
              but I am alone stacking sats, not knowing where I am on my long term
              HODL number.<br />
              Like a newcoiner before they learn to run a node,<br />
              I am alone, without a mempool of my own to broadcast from.<br /><br />

              Most people have too many coins;<br />
              I alone seem to be missing diversification.<br />
              My holdings are that of a “bell-curver”<br />
              in its highly concentrated allocation.<br />
              I am but a pleb in this world.<br />
              While others rush to trade with leverage,<br />
              I accept my humble DCA.<br />
              I alone seem foolish,<br />
              stacking sats, spending less.<br /><br />

              Other people strive for Twitter fame,<br />
              I avoid the Recommended tab,<br />
              preferring to be left anon.<br />
              Indeed, I seem like an idiot:<br />
              no altcoins, no worries.<br /><br />

              I drift like an unconfirmed transaction.<br />
              I move as effortless as the hashrate during wet season.<br /><br />

              All UTXOs settle after 6 confirmations.<br />
              I alone am stubborn and remain trusting at 0-conf.<br />
              But wherein I am most different from “cryptobros” is<br />
              in knowing to only stack the orange coin to self-custody!

              The greatest savings strategy is to stack sats and sats alone.<br />

              Satoshis are fungible and intangible,<br />
              Although fungible and intangible,<br />
              it gives rise to hard money.<br />
              Although distributed and opt-in,<br />
              it gives rise to consensus.<br />
              Although technical and obscure,<br />
              it is the money, the store of value,<br />
              the medium of all exchanges.<br /><br />

              Throughout the halvings, it's code has been preserved<br />
              in order to follow the Genesis block.<br />
              How do I know the ways of consensus at the beginning?<br />
              I look inside my full node and see what rules are within it.
